title: The Hardest Path
description: >-
  The stories in the Bible have always fascinated me, not because I’m deeply
  religious, but because they’ve endured for thousands of years for a reason.
  These aren’t just ancient myths; they reflect timeless truths about human
  struggles. They explore questions like how we handle suffering, face failure,
  and take responsibility for the chaos in our lives.
